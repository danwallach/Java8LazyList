Simple Java8 example code that demonstrates the use of a lazy list to interate
over a functional tree. 

FTree.java -- a simple, parametric functional tree
EmptyFTree.java -- an "empty" leaf node that we use instead of null
ITree.java -- the interface that a tree node has to implement
LazyList.java -- functional lazy lists, including support for parallel streams
Main.java -- test code that can drive all of the above and show you performance comparisons
